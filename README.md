## Overview 
Refactoring VBA code to analyze given stock data by year to improve performance and make the code more efficient.

## Results
Refactoring lead to organized, easier to read code, as well as improved performance when running. Due to increased performance the VBA script runs noticeably faster than before refactoring as shown in the pictures below:
### 2017 Data

 As you can see the year 2017 had more positive percentages of return than the year 2018.
 
## Results
Advantages of refractoring code include better organized code, code that is more specific to the task at hand, and improved performance time when running. Disadvantages of refractoring code include the time it takes to refactor the code may not yield enough results to draw conclusions about the data and it can create errors in the code in the process leading to it not being able to run properly. These pros and cons helped dislayed the original stock data in a more organized and clear way that others viewing the data will be able to read easily when looking for specific data.
